# Governance

The governance model adopted in Stanza is influenced by many CNCF projects.

## Principles

- **Open**: Stanza is an open source community.
- **Welcoming and respectful**: Stanza follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
- **Transparent and accessible**: Work and collaboration should be done in public.
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Project Maintainers

Maintainers are the first and foremost contributors that are committed to the success of Stanza project. Each maintainer should fulfill several of the following responsibilities:

* Strive to make stanza widely while taking care not to unjustifiably inflate its scope.
* Carefully consider input from the community and seek consensus with amongst maintainers.
* Create and classify GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
* Use ones best judgement to apply all applicable [labels](https://github.com/observiq/stanza/labels) to each new GitHub issue. 
* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them if they are not moving in a productive direction.
* Create releases of the library as necessary.

## Process of becoming a maintainer

* Understand that maintainers are expected to have a deep understanding of the project and that they should be able to independently fulfill maintainer responsibilities.
* Talk to some of the existing [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md). Explain that you are interested in becoming a maintainer and why you think you are a good fit for the role.
* Contribute increasingly complicated PRs under the guidance of the existing maintainers.
* When a maintainer believes you are ready, he or she may nominate you by creating a PR to add your to the list
